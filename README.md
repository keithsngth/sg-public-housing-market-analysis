<ins>Assignment Requirements</ins>

1. For this assignment, at least three datasets from the Housing Development Board (HDB) must be used:
https://data.gov.sg/dataset?organization=housing-and-development-board

2. For each dataset, you must write Python code that uses the Numpy package to extract useful statistical or summary information about the data.  You are not allowed to use Python packages like pandas to extract and transform the data.  This is to train you to know the Numpy package well.

3. Additionally, you must write Python code that uses the Matplotlib package to produce useful data visualizations that explain the data.  You are not allowed to use other visualization packages like seaborn to plot your graphs. This is to train you to know the Matplotlib library well. Your code should produce at least 4 of the following chart types:
* A bar chart
* A pie chart
* A line chart
* A histogram
* A scatterplot
* A boxplot 

4. Findings must be compiled into a PowerPoint deck for presentation.
